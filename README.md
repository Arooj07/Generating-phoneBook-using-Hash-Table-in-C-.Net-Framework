# Generating-phoneBook-using-Hash-Table-in-C-.Net-Framework
In this project I made a phoneBook using Hash tables in C# .Net Framework. I used int number as ids, and concatenate the two strings having name and number int it. As, C# Hash table is of non-generic type so don't need to mention specific data type for this. That's why I used phoneBook as a hash table and added phoneBook.Add(id, string). String here contains both name and number of a person. Also, I added some functionality in it like, data of a person can be added, got, display etc. also we can exit the phone book and clear the whole data history.
